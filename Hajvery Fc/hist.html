    <h1>History of FC Hajvery</h1>
    <div class="history-item">
        <h2>Founded in 2023</h2>
        <p>FC Hajvery was established with the aim of promoting football in the community. 
            It was founded by a group of local kids who shared a deep passion for the game. 
            They often played together in their neighborhood, enjoying the thrill of competition and the joy of teamwork. 
            Realizing their love for football could be transformed into something more, they decided to form a team that would represent
            them as a united club.
            The creation of FC Hajvery not only serves as a platform for these young athletes to showcase their skills but also 
            encourages more kids in the area to participate in sports. Football can be a powerful tool for building friendships,
            teaching discipline, and instilling a sense of responsibility. 
            By coming together as a team, these kids are not just playing a game; they are building a community where everyone can support
            one another, work towards common goals, and celebrate each otherâ€™s successes. 
            Moreover, the club can serve as an inspiration for others in the community, encouraging them to engage in physical 
            activities and promote a healthy lifestyle. The sense of belonging and camaraderie that comes from being part of a team can 
            have lasting positive effects on the players' lives, both on and off the field. In this way, FC Hajvery is more than just a 
            football team; it is a beacon of hope and unity for the local community.
